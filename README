A system to place incoming students into mathematics, statistics
and computer science classes.

Implementation is currently PHP based and communicates directly with
MySQL database.

Current ToDo:

Multi-thread - currently places students by iterating through list of 
students but in case of scaling we could place all students individually
in seperate threads.

Refactor - many functions are written specifically for placing
students with data specific to Grinnell College and thus need
to be generalized
